	    <p>"""Hello and welcome!I'm mkiyaga, a nature and wildlife photographer with a passion for capturing the beauty of Rwanda and Uganda's diverse landscapes and wildlife. From misty mountain peaks to lush rainforests, I explore every corner in search of those fleeting moments that tell the stories of the wild.

My photography journey started with a smartphone, and over time, it evolved into an art form and a way to connect with nature. Whether itâ€™s the soulful gaze of a mountain gorilla, the playful antics of golden monkeys, or the majesty of a sunrise over the Rwenzori ranges, I aim to freeze moments that inspire a deeper appreciation for the environment.

I believe that every photograph has a story to tell, and through this website, I invite you to join me on this visual journey across the natural wonders of Rwanda and Uganda.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope my work inspires you to explore and protect our planet's incredible biodiversity."""</p>
